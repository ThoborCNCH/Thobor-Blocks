# Thobor Website - Blockly Page

This is the repo that holds the blockly page for the thobor-team.com website.

The reason this is a separeate repo from the main website repository, is the fact that the integration of Blockly & React natively is really hard, and a waste of time, considering the scale of our website & this project.
